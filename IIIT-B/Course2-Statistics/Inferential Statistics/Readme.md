Welcome to the module on ‘Inferential Statistics’. 

 

In this module
Many a time, you may require a very large amount of data for your analysis which may need too much time and resources to acquire. In such situations, you are forced to work with a smaller sample of the data, instead of having the entire data to work with.

 

Situations like these arise all the time at big companies like Amazon. For example, say the Amazon QC department wants to know what proportion of the products in its warehouses are defective. Instead of going through all of its products (which would be a lot!), the Amazon QC team can just check a small sample of 1,000 products and then find, for this sample, the defect rate (i.e. the proportion of defective products). Then, based on this sample's defect rate, the team can "infer" what the defect rate is for all the products in the warehouses.

 

This process of “inferring” insights from sample data is called “Inferential Statistics”.
