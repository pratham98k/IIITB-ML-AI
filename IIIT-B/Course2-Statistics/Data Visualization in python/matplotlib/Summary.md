This session introduced you to the world of data visualisation. Throughout this session, you performed visualisations using Matplotlib. Now, let's summarise all that you learnt in this session.

You started this session by understanding the importance of visualisation in interpreting data. Then you learnt about the different types of graphs and charts, namely:

Bar chart
Scatter plot
Line graph
Histogram
Box plot
 

Further, you learnt about the elements that help display additional information about a plot. Also, you learnt how to fit several subplots inside a single plot object, which is useful for comparing different properties or elements of your data.
