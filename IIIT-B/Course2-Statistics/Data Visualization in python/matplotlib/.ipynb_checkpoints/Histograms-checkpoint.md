Histograms

A histogram is a frequency chart that records the number of occurrences of an entry or an element in a data set. It can be useful when you want to understand the distribution of a given series. Letâ€™s watch the next video to learn how to plot a histogram.

As shown in the video above, you can use the following command to plot a histogram:

 

plt.hist(profit, bins = 100,edgecolor='Orange',color='cyan')

plt.show()
 

After running this code, your histogram will look like the one given below. 

The x-ticks in the histogram above are not very informative. Let's try to add more detailed x-ticks so that the data is more readable. In the next video, you will learn how to add more information to classes and x-ticks.  

In the video above, you learnt how to use the hist() function to add more information to classes and x-ticks. Now that we have covered the basics of histograms, attempt the following questions.
