Case Study: Mind Map
Now that you have understood why data visualisation is crucial in drawing insights, let’s listen to Rahim as he gives a brief overview of this and the next session.
Here’s a brief mindmap of the contents of this module.

In the next segment, you’ll start working with a case study: Analysing the Google Play Store Ratings Dataset. Here, you’ll start with some basic data wrangling techniques, which you would have learnt in the previous modules 
For the data visualisation part, you’ll be revisiting the concepts of Matplotlib, which you learnt in the previous session. Then you’ll be introduced to the popular Seaborn library, which gives you access to a lot of flexible and aesthetic plotting methods. 
Towards the end of the module, you’ll also get a brief exposure to the library ‘Plotly’, which is another visualisation library that helps you make beautiful interactive charts in Python.
