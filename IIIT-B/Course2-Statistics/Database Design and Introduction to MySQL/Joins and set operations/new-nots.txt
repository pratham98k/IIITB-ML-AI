Let's go through the topics you mentioned one by one. I'll start by creating an example table and then demonstrate each of the topics.

### Example Table: `employees`

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    age INT
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary, age) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'HR', 55000, 28),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'Finance', 75000, 34),
(3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'IT', 92000, 40),
(4, 'Alice', 'Brown', 'HR', 62000, 29),
(5, 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Finance', 67000, 38),
(6, 'Jerry', 'Williams', 'IT', 56000, 27);
```

Now, let's move to each of the topics.

---

### 1. **Relational, Arithmetic, and Logical Operators**

#### Relational Operators
- `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

**Example: Find all employees with a salary greater than 60000**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000;
```

#### Arithmetic Operators
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

**Example: Add a 10% bonus to each employee's salary**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, salary * 1.10 AS salary_with_bonus FROM employees;
```

#### Logical Operators
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

**Example: Find employees in the 'Finance' department with a salary greater than 65000**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance' AND salary > 65000;
```

---

### 2. **Aggregate Functions**
- `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`

**Example: Get the total and average salary of employees**
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 3. **Regular Expressions**
- MySQL uses `REGEXP` to apply regex-based pattern matching.

**Example: Find employees whose first name starts with 'J'**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name REGEXP '^J';
```

---

### 4. **Nested Queries (Subqueries)**

**Example: Find employees whose salary is above the average salary**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

---

### 5. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**

**Example: Use a CTE to find employees older than 30**
```sql
WITH OlderEmployees AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30
)
SELECT * FROM OlderEmployees;
```

---

### 6. **Views**

**Example: Create a view to show only HR department employees**
```sql
CREATE VIEW HR_Employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';

-- Querying the view
SELECT * FROM HR_Employees;
```

---

### 7. **Advantages of Views Over CTEs**

- **Views** are persistent database objects that can be reused across multiple queries, while **CTEs** are only temporary for the duration of the query.
- Views can simplify complex queries, help with security by exposing limited data, and improve code reuse.
  
**Example: A view can be reused anytime, while a CTE is query-specific.**

---

### 8. **Union**

**Example: Combine employees from IT and Finance departments**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT'
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name, department FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance';
```

---

### 9. **Intersection**
Since MySQL doesn't have an explicit `INTERSECT`, you can achieve it using `INNER JOIN` or subqueries.

**Example: Find employees in both IT and Finance departments (this case, no overlap exists, but it's the pattern)**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT'
AND department IN (SELECT department FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance');
```

---

### 10. **Difference**

**Example: Employees in IT but not in Finance**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT'
AND department NOT IN (SELECT department FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance');
```

---

### 11. **Inner Join**

**Example: Suppose we have another table `projects`**

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    project_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(50),
    employee_id INT
);

INSERT INTO projects (project_id, project_name, employee_id) VALUES
(1, 'Project Alpha', 2),
(2, 'Project Beta', 3),
(3, 'Project Gamma', 5);

-- Query for inner join
SELECT employees.first_name, projects.project_name 
FROM employees
INNER JOIN projects ON employees.employee_id = projects.employee_id;
```

---

### 12. **Left Join**

**Example: Left join to show all employees and their projects (if they have one)**
```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, projects.project_name 
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN projects ON employees.employee_id = projects.employee_id;
```

---

### 13. **Right Join**

**Example: Right join to show all projects and their assigned employees (if any)**
```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, projects.project_name 
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN projects ON employees.employee_id = projects.employee_id;
```
