Introduction
Welcome to the session on 'Data sourcing'.

 

In this session:
To solve a business problem using analytics, you need to have historical data. Data is the key — the better the data, the more insights you can get out of it.


Typically, data comes from various sources and your first job as a data analyst is to procure the data from them. In this session, you will learn about various sources of data and how to source data from public and private sources. The broad agenda for this session is as follows:

Private Data
Public Data

### Public and Private Data
########################
There are two major kinds of data which can be classified according to the source:

## Public data

## Private data

A large amount of data collected by the government or other public agencies is made public for the purposes of research. Such data sets do not require special permission for access and are therefore called public data.

 

On the other hand, private data is that which is sensitive to organisations and is thus not available in the public domain. Banking, telecom, retail, and media are some of the key private sectors that rely heavily on data to make decisions.

 

Let’s listen to Anand talk about these types of data sets and how you can access them.

To summarise, there are two types of data - public and private, and each has its own problem. Public data isn’t always relevant and private data isn’t always easily available.

 

In the next lecture, you will learn about the various kinds of private data.

Private Data
A large number of organisations seek to leverage data analytics to make crucial decisions. As organisations become customer-centric, they utilise insights from data to enhance customer experience, while also optimising their daily processes.

 

Let's listen to Anand about how data in the banking, telecom and HR industries looks like and how it helps the companies make crucial decisions.

You learnt the use of data in the banking, telecom and human resources sectors. While banks use data to make credit related decisions, telecoms use data to optimise plans for customers and predict customer churn. HR data analytics helps identify and predict employee behaviour.

 

Let us now look at the applications of data analytics in retail and media, and what this data looks like.

In this lecture, you learnt the applications of data in the media and retail industries.

 

While retail data analytics helps drive decisions such as pricing and stocking, the media industry uses data extensively to target viewers better. Advertisers use data to identify best avenues for targeting customers, while journalists use data visualisation to aid information.

 

In the next lecture, you will learn about public data and how to source it.

Public Data
Previously, we talked about various private data sources. Now, let’s learn how to source public data sets. Public data is available on the internet on various platforms. A lot of data sets are available for direct analysis, whereas some of the data have to be manually extracted and converted into a format that is fit for analysis.


Let us now see how to source various types of public data from the internet.

Data Sourcing Anecdote - Agricultural Commodity Prices

 

Anand was presented a case by his client where he was tasked with forecasting commodity prices. Commodity prices, as the name suggests, are the prices of commodities such as oil, gold, silver, wheat, cotton, coffee, etc. that are traded in global trade markets. While an increase in commodity prices is indicative of economic growth, a fall in the same is indicative of a slowdown.


Let us see how Anand sourced the requisite data for analysis.

Optional Exercise - Sourcing Sports Data

If you are interested in sports, Awesome Public Datasets on GitHub contains a directory of sports data from tennis, cricket, football, basketball and other sports. For example, you can find the ball-by-ball data of all the IPL seasons (~600 matches). You may find it interesting to browse through it and do some EDA/modeling as a side project and add it to your resume. A project on IPL could serve as an interesting talking point in any job interview!

Summary
Let us summarise what we have learnt in the session.

We have learned two major kinds of data sources:

 

Public data: Data collected by the government or other public agencies that are made public for the purposes of research are known as Public data.
Private data: Data generated by Banking, telecom, retail, and media are some of the key private sectors that rely heavily on data to make decisions.
