To determine the size of the vocabulary after removing stop words, we need to follow these steps:

1. Load the training dataset.
2. Preprocess the text by removing stop words.
3. Tokenize the text to create a vocabulary.
4. Count the unique tokens in the vocabulary.

Here's a Python script to achieve this using the `nltk` library for stop words and `CountVectorizer` from `sklearn` for tokenization:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import nltk

# Download stopwords from nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Load the training dataset
train_data = pd.read_csv('movie_review_train.csv')

# Combine all reviews into a single list
reviews = train_data['text'].tolist()

# Initialize CountVectorizer with stop words
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words=stopwords.words('english'))

# Fit the vectorizer on the training data
vectorizer.fit(reviews)

# Get the size of the vocabulary
vocab_size = len(vectorizer.vocabulary_)

print(f"The size of the vocabulary after removing stop words is: {vocab_size}")
```

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

This script will output the size of the vocabulary after removing stop words. Note that the actual size may vary slightly depending on the preprocessing steps and the specific stop words list used.
