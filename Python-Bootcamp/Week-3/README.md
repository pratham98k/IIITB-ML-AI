Introduction
Welcome to the fourth session on 'Control Structures and Functions'. 
 
Control structures are the essence of programming; they help computers do what they do best: automate repetitive tasks intelligently. The most common control structures are if-else statements, for and while loops, and list and dictionary comprehensions. This session will cover all these concepts.
 
Another crucial thing you will learn in this session is how to write your own functions. Almost every powerful program, be it a web app or a machine learning algorithm, is a set of functions written to perform specific tasks.
