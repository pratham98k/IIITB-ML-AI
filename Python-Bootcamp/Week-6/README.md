Session Overview
Welcome to the session ‘Clean Coding Principles’.

Welcome back! In this module, we will delve into the fascinating world of clean coding principles. You've already covered various fundamental aspects of programming, including Python syntaxes, data structures, control structures and functions, as well as the powerful libraries of NumPy and Pandas. Now, it's time to take your programming skills to the next level by learning about the importance of clean coding and how it relates to the content you've already explored.


You might be wondering, "Why is clean coding so important?" Well, let's consider the scenario where you've spent countless hours working on a project, creating a complex algorithm or building a data analysis pipeline. While your code may function correctly, imagine if someone else, or even yourself in the future, needs to understand and modify it. Without clean coding practices, deciphering and modifying such code becomes an arduous task, leading to confusion and potential bugs.

Now, let's relate this back to the content you've covered thus far. Python syntaxes, data structures, control structures, and functions have provided you with the necessary tools to write functional code. However, clean coding takes your skills to a higher level by emphasizing best practices for structuring your code, choosing meaningful variable names, writing modular and reusable functions, and organizing your codebase effectively.

Furthermore, your familiarity with the NumPy and Pandas libraries has equipped you with powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis. By incorporating clean coding principles into your projects involving these libraries, you can ensure that your code is easy to understand, even when dealing with complex data operations.


Throughout this module, we will explore a variety of clean coding principles and techniques, such as code readability, proper code organization, meaningful variable and function names, efficient algorithm design, and much more. The next video will cover the topics that will be covered in this session. 

Meaningful naming convention: The name of the variable should always be descriptive and highlight its purpose.
Code modularisation: This refers to the principle of organising code into functions so that the function can be then reused, and the code looks concise and readable. It is also known as the ‘do not repeat yourself’ (DRY) principle.
Code optimisation: Code optimisation deals with the runtime execution and memory utilisation aspects of a program.
Code documentation: Code documentation ensures that the code is well-documented and highlights the details of each aspect of the code such as function arguments, return types and description.
Code linting: Code linting is the process of checking whether the guidelines associated with the programming language are followed. For example, Python follows the guidelines described in PEP8(Python Enhancement Proposal).
Now, you will learn about each of the above-mentioned principles through a demonstration. In the next video, you will learn about the importance of writing meaningful and descriptive names.
