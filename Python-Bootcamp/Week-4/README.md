Introduction to NumPy
Welcome to this module on Python for Data Science.

 

In this module
You will learn about the two most important and popular Python libraries for handling data: NumPy and Pandas. Let's hear from our SME, Behzad Ahmadi, who will explain the contents of the module in the following video. 

In this module, you will learn about the basics of NumPy, which is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy consists of a robust data structure called multidimensional arrays. Pandas is another powerful Python library that provides a fast and easy-to-use data analysis platform.


Important Note
To enhance the learning outcome, you are expected to pause the videos and code along with the instructor. You will be provided with a structured and blank IPython notebook for coding. It is a must for you to answer certain in-segment questions, as they serve the purpose of practice, and the final notebook will have practice tasks for you to solve.


Prerequisite for This Module
The learners are expected to have gone through the module on ‘Introduction to Python’ before beginning with this module.

 

In this session
In the following video, Behzad will talk about the scope of the session.

Creating NumPy Arrays
There are two ways to create NumPy arrays, which are mentioned below.

By converting the existing lists or tuples to arrays using np.array
By initialising fixed-length arrays using the NumPy functions
In this session, you will learn about both these methods. 


The key advantage of using NumPy arrays over lists is that arrays allow you to operate over the entire data, unlike lists. However, in terms of structure, NumPy arrays are extremely similar to lists. If you try to run the print() command over a NumPy array, then you will get the following output:


[element_1  element_2  element_3…]

 

The only difference between a NumPy array and a list is that the elements in the NumPy array are separated by a space instead of a comma. Hence, this is an aesthetic feature that differentiates a list and a NumPy array.


An important point to note here is that the array given above is a one-dimensional array. You will learn about multidimensional arrays in the subsequent segments.


Another feature of NumPy arrays is that they are homogeneous in nature. By homogenous, we mean that all the elements in a NumPy array have to be of the same data type, which could be an integer, float, string, etc
