Over the course of the program, you will be engaging in the following activities that go into the calculation of your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) at the end of the program:

Graded Questions: You are individually evaluated on the basis of your learning in the sessions and modules. These graded questions are in the form of Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). You will be receiving automatic feedback on these MCQs as soon as you attempt them. Graded questions will always be marked out separately at the end of sessions. Please note that questions within videos and session content are not graded, and are just to reinforce the concepts that you are learning. Graded questions will appear only towards the end of the session/module and will be explicitly marked as graded.

Assignments:  You are individually evaluated on the basis of your submissions (e.g. codes). Also, along with scores, individual qualitative feedback will be provided on your submissions. The assignments will be graded against a set of assessment criterion also known as rubrics given along with the assignment. So make sure to refer to the assessment criterion before and during attempting your assignments.

Group Projects: You will apply your learning as a group of data analysts to industry-relevant problems. Along with scores, individual qualitative feedback will be provided on your submissions. Similar to assignments, case studies will be graded against a set of assessment criterion.

Online Exams: Online proctored exams will assess your conceptual clarity on all that you have learnt. We have planned one exam after Course 4 (for courses 1 to 4 ) and one after Course 6 (for courses 5 and 6). There will be 2 online exams for EPGP ML and MS ML Learners and 1 online exam for EPGC ML & NLP and EPGC ML & DL Learners. The dates of these exams will be released and updated on the calendar. You will have a choice to choose between one of the two exam slots.

We expect every student to attempt each of these graded elements with the highest academic integrity. Any incidents of plagiarism or cheating will be treated very severely by the academic committee of IIITB.

Program Assessment and Grading Structure

Your Grade Point Average (GPA) will be computed for every course/capstone project based on a series of assessments. The weightage of different components of assessment is as stated below:

Course	Assignment	Case Study	MCQ	Exam
Stats	0	40	40	20
ML 1	40	0	40	20
ML 2	25	15	35	25
DL and NN	25	15	35	25
NLP	25	15	30	30
Course 6 Electives	30	20	20	30
Capstone	80	0	20	0
 

 As you receive a GPA for each course, you will build your cumulative grade point average (CGPA). Here is how the CGPA for the program is computed:

The program has a total of 36 credits as follows for EPGP ML:


Course	Credits
Statistics Essentials	3
Machine Learning 1	4
Machine Learning 2	5
Neural Networks and Deep Learning	6
Natural Language Processing	6
Elective Course	7
Capstone	5


The GPA scores you receive for each course weighted by its respective proportion of credits, add up to the CGPA for the entire program.

 

For instance, if the grade points awarded to a student are G1, G2, etc. in courses with corresponding credits U1, U2, etc., the CGPA = (U1G1 + U2G2 + ....) / (U1 + U2 +…), wherein U1, U2 refer to all courses taken up to the time of computation.

You will be evaluated on a 4 point scale and the passing grade for a course is D (1 on a 4 point scale). However, to get the EPGP certificate, your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) should be at least 2.4. 


*Although the professor mentions that the individual minimum is required for each component such as assignment, case study, graded questions and exams in the above video. 

But that criteria have been changed and the learners will now have to score >=25% marks at an overall level to pass a particular course.*

Please note that to receive the certificate post-program completion, the minimum required CGPA remains the same i.e 2.4

For more details on credit structure, grading and GPA calculation for your respective programs, refer to your respective “Student Manual” in the oncoming segment.

 

Assessment Timelines

You will be notified about the assessment timelines well in advance to help you plan your submissions well within deadlines.

 
 The student calendar will be the central point where you can view all timelines related to assessments and live sessions in one place. The release dates and submission deadlines for all assessments will be stated on your calendar. We consider every Monday to be the deadline.  The calendar for each course will be updated at the beginning of the course itself so that you can plan your learning experience for that course.

 The submission deadlines are non-negotiable. You will have sufficient notice to prepare for your assignments and submit them before the deadlines. If you submit the assignments or case studies after the deadline or attempt graded MCQs after the deadline, but before one week after the deadline, you will be graded on 70% of the original marks (you will incur a 30% penalty).

 
 If you delay your assignments or graded MCQs beyond a week after the original deadline, you will be given a zero in the assignment/graded MCQ, however, feedback will be provided on your assignment submission. For e.g. if the deadline was 2nd August 2018, 11:59:00 PM, then all submission made from 2nd August, 2018, 11:59:01 PM to 9th August, 2018, 11:59:00 PM will attract a penalty of 30% (which means that if your score after grading the assignment was let’s say 100/150, then your score after penalty will be 70/150). Submissions from 9th August 2018, 11:59:01 PM will attract a penalty of 100% i.e. will be given zero marks.


 Note: As mentioned above, all the graded MCQs also need to be attempted within the module deadline to avoid any penalties.

 

Group Formation and Class Participation

You would be expected to form your own group for the group case study assignment. Any group that you form needs to meet the following criteria:

Each group should consist of  2 students for group projects

You will be allowed to select new groups from time to time so that you interact with more of your peers. You may choose to remain in the same group.

Class participation for every course will be scored based on the following:

Completion of your student profile on the platform

Your ongoing discussion forum score

Our TAs will constantly be monitoring the discussion forum activity to ensure fair participation by all.

 

Also, please go through the Code of Conduct that you will be expected to abide by during the course of this program
